Title: Wrapper Around tictoc To Use Logging
Version: 0.1.0
Author: aguynamedryan
Maintainer: The package maintainer <aguynamedryan@gmail.com>
Description: licloc is a wrapper around tictoc.  I needed a way to show nested
    tics and tocs and wanted tictoc to log messages by default.  Rather than 
    modify the original tictoc, I created some, admittedly convulted, functions 
    that wrap `tic` and `toc`.
